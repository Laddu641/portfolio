            <p>Industrious recent computer science graduate with a zeal for innovation. Seeking a position
               at reputed companies, where the strategic focus on delighting users aligns with my
               creativity and desire to enhance social events through technology. Iam an innovative 
               and enthusiastic computer science educator with a passion for critical thinking, 
               problem solving and sharing a love for technology and science. I have an ability to 
               work creatively in small and large team environments. During my bachelor's I have
               learnt lot of technologies like Machine Leaning, IOT, Data Science, Cloud Computing, 
               Web Development, Networking and many more... upon that I was still intrested in learning 
               new technologies. In the course of computer science I have trained under some of the 
               programming languages like C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS and MySQL. Later I took it upon myself
               to learn JavaScript which is useful for both front-end and back-end development. Now 
               looking for an opportunity to use these skills in a collaborative environment with other
               passionate technologies.
